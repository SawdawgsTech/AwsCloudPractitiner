#cloud first steps
i heard the island stabilization system is malfunctioning
i think we can use amazon ec2 to solve this problem
amazon elastic compute cloud, or amazon ec2, is a web service that provides reliable, scalable, compute capacity in the cloud so that you can launch virtual servers in mins.
as you mentioned, devices can fail at any time. to help improve server resilence, you can use aws infrastructure to place amazon ec2 servers into two different availability zones
an availability zone, or az, is a logical data center in an aws region that has redundant and separate power, networking, and connectivity. each az is supported by one or more physical data center.
zone a= computational module a/amazon ebs volume 
zone b= computational module b/amazon ebs volume
ran by stabilization device 
amazon elastic compute cloud overview
ec2/ web service / resizable compute capacity / eliminates upfront hardware investment / so u can develop and deply things faster
